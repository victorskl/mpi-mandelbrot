MPI and Mandelbrot Set
----------------------
This project experiment MPI programming for counting the total sum of complex points that fall under a Mandelbrot Set. The objective is to achieve the maximum speedup possible.

This assignment work is done for COMP90025 Project 1C assessment 2016 SM2, The University of Melbourne. You can read [the report](SanKhoLin_829463_COMP90025_Project1C_Report.pdf). You may also want to read the related [`openmp-mandelbrot`](https://github.com/victorskl/openmp-mandelbrot) assignment. The implementation still has room for improvement. You may wish to cite this work as follow.
